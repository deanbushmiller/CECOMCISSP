# Prerequisite readings
Since I do not know what you do not know, I need you to read it all or make a judgment call that you understand the material prior to class time.
  50 PDFs=72MB - if you have not done other preparation this will take many hours (100-200)
  The readings represent the knowledge necessary to get the most from class. 
  They do not represent 4 to 6 years worth of CISSP knowledge that is required to attempt the exam.
# What is your goal?
  Passing the exam?
  Solving cyber-security problems?
  If either of these is the case - you are in the right place.
# Order of domain coverage
  Day 1 - GRM - Security Governance Risk Management & KAS - Knowledge Asset Security
  Day 2 - SAE - Security Architecture & ANT - Assessment and Testing
  Day 3 - IAM - Identity Access Management & DEV - Software Development Security
  Day 4 - CNS - Communications and Network Security & OPS - Operations Security
# What happens before class
  Get 500 Notecards (3x5)& 4 color pen (BIC 4-Color)
  Read mindmaps in the above order.
  Each mindmap is a set of content for the domain. (folder above)
# What happens in class
You should be worn out by the end of each day from thinking and doing.
  Everyone participates all the time.
  There is no lecture. We do not spend time defining terms. Here are the required terms of a CISSP. (LINK)
We will do the actions that build the mental representations a CISSP will use in both the exam and in their daily work.
## 6 activities of class 
More difficult activities = better learning.
These activities have been tested over 20 years.
They are the best deliberate practice you can get.
Each day we will cover 2 domains using these activities:
  THREATS & CONTROLS - Given a threat what is best control in this domain?
  RISK - What analysis steps is this?
  SDLC - Where are we in the software development life cycle? What are the security requirements at this point?
  CASE - What is wrong in this case and how will you fix this the CISSP way?
  BEST PRACTICES - Which best practice is being exhibited or broken in the example?
  Q&A - You must read mindmaps before class to ask questions.
### Time limits
Each domain will have a time limit - if we get caught up in an activity  and do not get to every activity - then fine we are excited and learning.
At the end of each day, we will vote on the order of activities for the next day.
## First day - first hour
Level set quiz 60 question 60 minutes- no guessing
  This exam will be as hard as the real exam.
