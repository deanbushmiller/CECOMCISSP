  50 PDFs 72MB - this will take 
  The readings represent the knowledge necessary to get the most from class.

# What is your goal?
  Passing the exam?
  Solving cyber-security problems?
  If either of these is the case - you are in the right place.
# What happens in class
You should be worn out by the end of each day from thinking and doing.
  Everyone participates all the time.
  There is no lecture. We do not spend time defining terms (You can get that from a 1000 places.)
We will do the actions that build the mental representations a CISSP will use in both the exam and their daily activities.
  You are a professional managing cyber security personnel.
